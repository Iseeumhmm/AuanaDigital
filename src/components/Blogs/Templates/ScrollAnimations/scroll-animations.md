# Scroll Manipulation

The hydro was out here for a couple hours yesterday but I happened to have my camera batteries charged.  We have a large windows that spills light nicely onto the floor beside my desk.  I thought I’d take advantage of that light and make the animation you just saw.  Nothing fancy here, just a camera laying on a white piece of plastic on the floor.  I recorded myself removing the lens and after some really quick and dirty masking in Premiere, some javascript to prop it up on this page and voilà we have a scroll animation.

I find that when a page subtlety changes the gesture behaviour that you’re expecting, it really adds to the experience.  It once again goes that extra step to engage the visitor, allowing them to interact with the page in a fresh way, that is hopefully both memorable and enjoyable.  
<br />
The practical uses for this are endless, particularly for product presentations or displaying any kind of documentation in a more interactive and, let’s face it, less boring way.

These techniques aren’t proprietary scripts belonging to the corporate giants, this is all just code implemented behind the scenes.  We can use them freely in our own projects and websites.

There are so many more cool things we can do when implementing front end web designs!  Stay tuned!
