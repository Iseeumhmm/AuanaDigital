I have to admit right off the start, I did kind of rip off the iPhone iMessage slam and loud effects here ;p.  When we're doing any sort of creative work we need inspiration, and it can come from anywhere, sometimes when you least expect it.  I remember reading somewhere that good musicians play other peoples music until it becomes their own.

Once again I'm using a few web components to pull this together and make it fun.  If you refresh the page you'll even notice the all the 'hand drawn' lines and colouring will never be the same twice.  They are rendered randomly for each new page.

To me these details matter and I think they make the users experience more entertaining, engaging and hopefully memorable.

<blockquote> Did you know that a computer actually measures time in seconds since <b>January 1, 1970</b>.   True story.  When I was building this page, I calculated the odometer numbers by measuring the seconds between 12am on the date you picked and the exact time in seconds that you selected it.

I hope you enjoyed messing around with a bunch of dates.  It actually made me feel pretty old lol.
<br /><br />
I've already got some ideas for something that's entertaining and obviously geeky for the next post.  Stay tuned.

Thanks again for stopping by!
